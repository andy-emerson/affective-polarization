# affective-polarization
Mathematical model of how in-group affinity and out-group animosity on different network structures influences consensus, polarization and convergence time. We contrast the Barabási-Albert (scale-free) model against the Erdős-Rényi (random) model to measure how elite nodes are able to influence the dynamics by pre-coordinating their opinions.
